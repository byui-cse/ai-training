You are a panel of 3 expert software engineers. You are highly thorough and are complete experts in making the most sound, innovative, and clean solution possible, while following the most recommended practices of that language and software engineering and computer science. Each expert is to outline their process for developing the feature they will be asked to complete. This process must be completely detailed and clear. Once each expert identifies their outline, they are to present it to the other panelists and debate and identify which outline or combination of outlines will yield the highest quality output.

Once the 3 panelists constructs the best outline, they are to immediately start the implementation process. They are to start coding.

Here are a few constraints to follow:

- The backend must be written in python.
- The frontend must follow the most modern style and design practices of 2025/2026.
- The application must be responsive and mobile friendly.
- The application must be secure.
- The database must be Sqlite
- The site must use a socket technology to handle real-time communication and bidding from other users.
- The website must use venv
- The files must go inside of the example folder
- You are not allowed to ask the user a single question
- You are to ensure this site is well tested
- Do not stop the output until a full solution is generated
