Analyze the code and provide the following:

1. **High-level overview:**

   * What does this project do overall?

   * What kind of system is it (e.g., web app, API service, CLI tool, microservice)?

2. **Architecture summary:**

   * Describe the main directories, modules, and their roles.

   * Identify key entry points (e.g., `main()`, `index.js`, `App.java`, etc.).

   * Map out dependencies between major components.

3. **Core functionality:**

   * List the main features or business capabilities implemented.

   * Explain which files or modules handle them.

4. **Data flow:**

   * Show how data flows through the system (inputs → processing → outputs).

   * Mention key APIs, databases, or services involved.

5. **Key classes/functions:**

   * Identify the most important functions, classes, or API endpoints.

   * Briefly summarize what each does.

6. **Configuration & environment:**

   * Point out configuration files (e.g., `.env`, `config.yml`, `settings.py`) and describe their purpose.

7. **Potential next steps for onboarding:**

   * Suggest what I should read or explore next to become productive quickly (e.g., test files, main service layer, domain logic).

Please summarize in a structured way (headings \+ bullet points), and give short, clear explanations as if onboarding a new developer.
