# SCRATCHPAD

All decisions, notes, and thoughts go here as per constraints.

## Initial Notes
- Task: Build an auction website with Python backend
- Existing structure: Basic folder structure already exists with backend/frontend separation
- Backend must be Python
- Need to follow product development team process with personas

## Process Steps Required
1. Create SCRATCHPAD.md ✓
2. Create PRODUCT_OWNER.md and STAFF_ENGINEER.md thinking files
3. Product Owner creates BACKLOG.md
4. Staff Engineer creates plan and architecture
5. Major decisions go to DECISIONS.md
6. Get approval before implementing any work

## Current State
- Empty backend directories
- Empty frontend directories
- Product backlog created with MVP features defined
- Architecture decisions made (FastAPI, PostgreSQL, React, WebSockets)

## Architecture Decisions Made
- Backend: FastAPI (Python web framework)
- Database: PostgreSQL with SQLAlchemy ORM
- Authentication: JWT tokens with refresh token rotation
- Real-time: WebSockets for bidding updates
- Frontend: React.js with modern hooks
- Testing: pytest with 95% coverage requirement
- Deployment: Docker containers

## Approval Status
- Product Backlog: Created and reviewed ✓
- Technical Architecture: Defined and documented ✓
- Backend Implementation: In progress
- Authentication System: Implemented ✓
- Database Models: Implemented ✓
- Basic API Endpoints: Implemented ✓
- Testing Setup: Basic tests created
- Docker Configuration: Created

## Current Implementation Status
- ✅ FastAPI backend project structure
- ✅ Database models (User, Category, Item, Bid)
- ✅ Pydantic schemas for API validation
- ✅ Authentication service (JWT, password hashing)
- ✅ User management service
- ✅ Auth API endpoints (register, login, get current user)
- ✅ User API endpoints (CRUD operations)
- ✅ Database initialization with sample data
- ✅ Basic unit tests for authentication
- ✅ Docker setup for deployment
- ✅ Documentation and configuration files

## Next Steps
- Implement item management endpoints
- Implement bidding system with validation
- Add auction timing and winner determination logic
- Set up React frontend
- Add comprehensive testing
- Implement real-time WebSocket features
