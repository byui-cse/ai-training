# Product Owner Thinking Process

Step-by-step thinking as Product Owner:

1. Understand the task: Build an auction website with Python backend
2. Focus on customer needs: What features would customers expect from an auction site?
3. Create comprehensive backlog covering all necessary features
4. Ensure all items are customer-focused and business valuable
5. Prioritize features based on MVP vs nice-to-have

Thinking through auction website features from customer perspective:
- Users need to be able to register and login
- Users need to browse auction items
- Users need to place bids
- Sellers need to list items for auction
- Real-time bidding updates would be expected
- Payment processing after winning bids
- Item categories and search functionality
- User profiles and bidding history
- Admin capabilities for managing auctions

Core MVP features should include:
1. User registration/authentication
2. Item listing (by sellers)
3. Item browsing (by bidders)
4. Bidding functionality
5. Auction timing (start/end times)
6. Winning bid determination
7. Basic admin panel

Need to create backlog with these features broken down into actionable items.
