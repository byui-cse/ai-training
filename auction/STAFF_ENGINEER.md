# Staff Engineer Technical Planning - Auction Website

## Step 1: Technology Stack Analysis
Backend: Python - FastAPI for modern async API, SQLAlchemy for ORM, Pydantic for validation
Frontend: HTML/CSS/JS - Vanilla for simplicity, Bootstrap/Material Design for modern look
Database: SQLite for development, PostgreSQL for production
Testing: pytest for unit tests, coverage for metrics

## Step 2: Architecture Design
Follow Clean Architecture principles:
- Domain layer: Core business logic (Auction, Bid, User entities)
- Application layer: Use cases (CreateAuction, PlaceBid, etc.)
- Infrastructure layer: Database adapters, external services
- Presentation layer: API endpoints, HTML templates

## Step 3: Database Schema Planning
Core entities:
- Users (id, email, password_hash, role, created_at)
- Items (id, title, description, starting_price, current_price, seller_id, start_time, end_time, status)
- Bids (id, item_id, bidder_id, amount, timestamp)

Relationships: User has many Items, Item has many Bids, Bid belongs to User and Item

## Step 4: API Design
RESTful endpoints:
- POST /users - Register user
- POST /auth/login - Login
- GET /items - List auctions
- POST /items - Create auction
- POST /items/{id}/bids - Place bid
- GET /users/{id}/items - User listings
- GET /users/{id}/bids - User bids

## Step 5: Frontend Architecture
Simple SPA structure:
- index.html - Home page
- login.html - Authentication
- create-item.html - New auction form
- item-detail.html - Auction page with bidding
- profile.html - User dashboard

CSS: Modern design with flexbox/grid, clean typography, responsive design

## Step 6: Security Considerations
- Password hashing (bcrypt)
- JWT tokens for authentication
- Input validation and sanitization
- CSRF protection
- HTTPS enforcement

## Step 7: Testing Strategy
Unit tests for:
- Business logic (auction rules, bid validation)
- API endpoints
- Database operations
- Authentication logic

Target: 95%+ code coverage

## Step 8: Development Phases
Phase 1: Core backend (users, items, bids)
Phase 2: Frontend integration
Phase 3: Polish and testing
Phase 4: Deployment preparation

## Step 9: Code Quality Standards
- PEP 8 compliance
- Type hints throughout
- Docstrings for all public functions
- Pre-commit hooks for linting
- CI/CD pipeline for automated testing
